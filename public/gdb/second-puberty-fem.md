# 雌性激素造成的第二青春期 101

## 从女性化激素替代治疗（HRT）中能期待什么

这是一篇讲述医学改变的文章。本文由生理性别为男的、接受了以雌激素为主的激素替代治疗的跨性别群体的亲身经历编写。这些信息主要来自于社交媒体和聊天室。这意味着这些信息可能不可信，但是大多数跨性别医学研究都有可能不可信，因为没人愿意出资支持跨性别医学研究。

**请注意，这些只是 _可能_ 出现的改变。每一个接受女性化HRT的人并不一定都会经历全部变化。你的年龄、基因、医疗历史、从第一次青春期开始的男性化程度、以及激素水平都会对结果有所影响。并且，随机性也会参与到其中，因为每个人的身体都是不一样的。一些改变也可能需要多年时间才会显现**

### 胸部发育

与大众的印象不同，跨性别女性中的大部分人并不会去追求胸部增大，因为它并不重要（而且对于很多人来说，也很难做到）。每个人出生时都拥有乳腺组织，在缺少雌激素刺激成长的情况下，它只会一直保持休眠状态。胸部发育一般需要2-5年时间，但是最长也可持续到10年，就像顺性别女性那样。

胸部发育时会产生疼痛，乳晕内部和周围也会有压痛感。请避免用胸部撞到任何东西上，因为这样做*真的*会很痛。乳头和乳晕会变得更加敏感，也会变得更大、更暗。你需要购入一些运动内衣。

这也可能会伴随着泌乳。当输乳管成形，并打开时，会有一些正常的泌乳，所以并不比特别注意。但是如果在没有可以刺激的情况下出现了大量泌乳，可能会出现泌乳素失衡的问题。如果该问题发生，请咨询医生。

### 皮肤变细

睾酮会让皮肤的表皮层变厚、变硬。所以抑制睾酮后，皮肤会变得更薄。并且，雌激素会提高胶原蛋白的产量，也会使皮肤变得更软、更加有光泽。腿部静脉曲张可能会更加明显。经过时间消退的纹身可能会变得更粗、更清晰。

抑制睾酮后，皮肤油脂也会变得更少，面部和头皮更甚。这会导致粉刺和头皮屑的明显减少。

### 柔韧性增强

睾酮会让水更好地保留在韧带和筋腱中，让它们更难被拉伸。抑制雄激素会让身体从韧带中去除这些水分，柔韧性也会变得更好。

### 手和手腕变细

{!{

{{import '~/img' images.hands className="card" caption="原作者的手。这些变化发生在三年半间。"}}
</div>
}!}

当皮肤开始变软、变细的时候，手也会逐渐开始缩小。因为没有睾酮，流经手部的血流减小，造成组织进一步地缩小。因为脂肪和体液离开手指，戒指的尺寸也会变小。因为韧带变细且更柔软，手指长度也会变短。

### 足部变小

就像手部一样，脚部也会经历形状上的变化。雄激素会促使更多血液流向脚部，也会在软骨储存更多水分。雌激素会让足部韧带更加柔韧。这两者合起来会让足弓变大，足部长度缩短可达2厘米。很多人称自己的鞋码小了一到两码。

### 指甲变薄、变软

指甲由角蛋白组成，而很多角蛋白基因由雄激素受体激活而变厚。抑制睾酮会让指甲变薄，也更容易被破坏。

### 体毛变少

体毛并不会完全停止生长。当毛囊受DHT的影响发育完成的时候，它就会一直保持那样。但是，像指甲一样，体毛疏密受角蛋白影响，而角蛋白基因由雄激素受体激活。抑制雄激素会让体毛变得更细、更稀疏。但是遗传基因在这方面也扮演者很重要的角色。

### 体温分布的改变

Androgens encourage extra blood flow to extremities, making them warmer. Because of this, women tend to have warmer core temperatures but lower oral and surface level temperatures. You may see your basal body temperature drop to around 97.6.

This unfortunately results in a reduced tolerance to cold, so expect to need to layer clothing more frequently, especially since many buildings [set their thermostats for male comfort levels](https://www.popsci.com/study-finds-gender-bias-office-air-conditioning/).

### 排汗方式的改变

With the above shift in temperature distribution, this also results in a significant change in how one sweats. Sweat becomes more of a full body experience, as opposed to largely centered on the head and armpits. Underboob sweat becomes a thing.

### 体味变小或改变

A major component in male body odor is the presence of [the steroid pheromone androstadienone](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070916143523.htm) in sweat. Androstadienone is metabolized directly from testosterone, so halting testosterone removes the source. Without it, sweat takes on a much sweeter smell, which is often attributed to feminine odors.

People taking spironolactone may experience a total cessation of any body odor, due to the way the drug alters cortisol uptake within the body.

### 肌肉量减小

Androgens stimulate muscle growth, which is why anabolic steroids (which are literally testosterone) are so common amongst body builders. People running on androgens naturally have more muscle mass, particularly in the upper body, without even having to work out. Removing androgens causes that muscle mass to atrophy and makes it harder to gain muscle. This is a major contributor to the feminine shoulder and neck line, as well as the waist line.

With this comes a significant loss in strength. Carrying things becomes more difficult, pickle jars become harder to open.

### 脂肪分布女性化

Androgens encourage the body to deposit fats into the abdomen, while estrogen encourages the body to deposit fats into the thighs, buttocks, and hips. Switching profiles causes new fats to be deposited according in the estrogen profile, and fats that were stored while on androgens break down. This produces the illusion of fat migration as the shape of the body changes. The waist line shrinks and defines itself below the ribs, and the belly becomes softer and flatter.

Because estrogen deposits weight much lower on the body, and the muscle mass in the upper body is lost, this lowers the center of gravity, which alters one's walking gait. It becomes more natural to cantilever the body with the hips while walking, as opposed to the shoulders.

### 面部特征的改变

Along with body fat migration, fat in the face also migrates. The neck, chin and jaw line thin out while the lips and upper cheeks puff up. The brow and upper eye lids lift, exposing more of the eyeball. Changes in skin and musculature around the eye can alter the shape of the eyeball, changing focal depth and altering vision clarity. The color of the eyes may also change and become bolder, as testosterone causes the pigmentation in the iris to fade.

This is an extremely subtle and slow moving process that takes years, and it is easy to think nothing is changing at all. Take selfies to compare.

### 头皮和头发的改变

With the removal of androgens, blood flow to the scalp increases. Follicles that had been lost to male pattern baldness may reactivate, causing some return of the hair line and a filling in of bald spots. Scalp hair becomes thicker and follicles grow stronger, allowing hair to grow to longer lengths.

With this thickening, curliness may become more pronounced, and a change in hair color may also occur. You might find your hair taking on a texture more like your mother's than your father's.

### [骨盆前倾](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_tilt)

As musculature atrophies, ligament flexibility increases, and weight shifts lower on the body, the orientation of the pelvic bone in relation to the spine and femurs rotates forward. Not by much, only about 10-20 degrees, but enough to cause a change in the alignment of the spine and hips, increasing arch of the back and causing the buttocks to jut out more. The added arch to the back can cause a relative drop in total height, between 1 and 2 inches (2-5cm) depending on pelvic shape.

Note, this is NOT the same as the [hip rotation](https://youtu.be/OROoZzoVwfk?t=12) that occurs in AFAB puberty and during pregnancy. That is the result of migration of bone cells, altering the shape of the pelvic bone itself. **However**, hip rotation *can* occur if the person is young enough to still be within initial puberty, where the body is producing elevated human growth hormone. There have also been examples of hip rotation happening over long periods of time in trans elders. In 2017 an 80 year old trans woman reported on reddit that over the course of her 30 years on HRT, her doctor observed changes in her pelvis consistent with female hip rotation.

### 咖啡因、酒精、或精神药品耐性降低

Less body mass means less blood to dilute chemicals into. Losing testosterone also means a slower metabolic rate, decreasing the speed at which toxins are reduced from the blood stream. Some anti-androgens also put strain on the liver, further reducing how quickly chemicals are processed.

### 心态改变

As covered in the [Biochemical Dysphoria]() section, brains can be wired for a certain hormone profile, and running on the wrong profile is like using a laptop with low batteries or an overheated processor. Starting HRT almost universally results in a cessation of depersonalization and derealization (DPDR) symptoms within the first two weeks. A mental fog lifts, and it becomes easier to concentrate on complex concepts (assuming you don't also have other mental processing difficulties such as ADHD).

##### 注意缺陷与多动障碍（ADHD）

If you have ADHD, there may be some changes in your symptoms. Androgens amplify [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) receptor function, so reducing testosterone can reduce the activation potential for dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the behavior of [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), the short-term memory of the brain. Less working memory means you become more prone to distractions and have more difficulty maintaining [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load).

The good news is that estradiol prompts the brain to produce MORE dopamine.

{!{ <div class="gutter flex" style="justify-content: flex-end"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title">Authors Note:</h4> }!}

There is a known problem with Spironolactone hampering working memory due to it's affects on mineralcorticoids. This can significantly worsen ADHD issues and make it much harder to maintain focus or be aware of your surroundings. I was involved in a car accident in 2017 that I blame on spiro fog.

{!{ </div></div></div> }!}

##### 情感扩大

The alleviation of DPDR almost universally is accompanied with a much broader capacity for emotion and expression. The stoicism and dissociation lifts and emotions land with much greater intensity. Highs are higher and lows are lower. Those who may have been unable to cry, before transition, gain it back, both for sadness and for joy.

Unfortunately this also means that if you had trauma from events earlier in life (and who doesn't), you may start to experience PTSD episodes. This is why it is good (and in some places, required) to have a therapist.

##### 情绪波动

As estrogen levels fluctuate between doses you may experience noticeable and sometimes dramatic shifts in your mood. Unexplained crying happens; PMS rage happens; be ready for it.

##### 食欲

Many people report being unable to eat as much as they could pre-transition. The loss of lean muscle in the arms and shoulders means that the body has a reduced capacity for burning lipids, and as such the fullness sensation occurs earlier.

However, progesterone increases mitochondrial function within the body, boosting metabolic rate. This can cause an increase in appetite as the body attempts to replenish calories burned.

That said, you may find yourself unable to eat *as much* food as you could before. Many report that they become full/satisfied sooner than before.

##### 睡眠

Many people report having better sleep patterns after starting HRT. This is likely a factor of the alleviation of DPDR, as it seems to occur in both AMAB and AFAB trans people. That said, initiating progesterone can *significantly* improve sleep, allowing for deeper sleep and more dreaming.

##### 外向

It's extremely common for trans people of all types to find themselves much more sociable post-transition. This may not actually be a factor of hormone therapy, however, an simply be a result of no longer having to suppress large portions of their personality.

### 感觉功能增强

Transgender HRT has [been shown several times](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/5/1582/3064956) to cause changes in the distribution of gray matter and white matter within the brain for trans people on both forms of HRT. New structures and neuro-pathways are formed as a result of the shift in hormone profiles, and this results in changes of sensory perception. These are some of the changes that have been observed and reported, but it is is not clear if this is a function of the hormones themselves, or a factor of the brain receiving the hormones it is wired for.

- **Improved sense of smell**, especially of other bodies. Human sweat becomes very discernible, even overpowering at times.
- **Improved color perception**. Colors may become bolder, richer.
- **Improved spatial awareness**. Many trans people experience poor proprioception and a tendency towards clumsiness that goes away after starting HRT.
- **Changes in perception of taste**. Certain foods become more or less palatable; Cilantro, for example, may become more or less soapy. Increased tolerance of capsaicin (spicy peppers). Chocolate and wine become more flavorful.

Users of Spironolactone often develop strong cravings for foods high in salt, such as pickles, olives, or potato products. This is because Spiro is a potassium sparing diuretic which causes you to pee out all your sodium. The brain creates cravings to encourage you to replace that sodium.

### 空间感知变化，自信减小

There is a very frequently reported experience of feeling smaller within the world, even when wearing heels. People taller than you seem to tower over you, and spaces feel larger.

People have also reported a tendency to be less prone to start arguments, an a desire to avoid confrontation rather than create it. Testosterone has been shown to increase a persons sense of confidence, and removing it has the opposite affect.


### 生殖器改变

{!{
<div class="gutter flex">
{{import '~/img' images.homology link='https://www.vielma.at/' }}
</div>
}!}

All genitalia are constructed from the same tissues, they are merely organized differently during gestation. Much of the behavior of these tissues is regulated by the hormones ones body runs on. Skin secretions, textures, sensitivity and erectile behavior are all hormonal expressions. Which means that when you remove androgens and add estrogens, these tissues start acting like they are in the shape of a vulva, even though they aren't.

##### 敏感度增加

The skin on the glans and shaft becomes much thinner and fragile, more prone to tearing and irritation, while also becoming *significantly* more sensitive to touch. The entire organ also becomes much more sensitive to pressure, and vibration becomes a better form of stimulation over stroking, which may become painful.

#### 潮湿及女性化味道

The skin along the shaft begins to secret the same fluids as the vaginal canal, particularly during arousal (yes, trans girls get wet). These fluids encourage the development of the same microbiome that develops within the vaginal canal. The combination of these factors means that odor (and taste) of the penis changes to align more to that of a vulva. 

##### 颜色和肤质的改变

The scrotum is an analog of the outer and inner labia, and softens to take on a softer, more velvety texture, extending down into the perineum. The skin along the perineal raphe (the vertical line where the vulva opening had been before the scrotum formed) will also darken. Some people experience a kind of striping pattern along the scrotum.

##### 更少的射精

Without free floating testosterone, the levels of [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) in the bloodstream drop significantly. DHT plays a major role in the stimulation of random erections during sleep through the enlargement of the prostate, and these erections are what is responsible for the maintenance of the erectile tissue. Without DHT, the prostate shrinks again, and random erections cease (no more morning wood).

However this means that the erectile tissue will begin to atrophy. Prolonged atrophy will result in shrinkage of the entire organ, for better or worse. The shape of the penis changes as this occurs, often becoming more conical. The glans is the first part to shrink and may lose the ability to become rigid. Penetrative sex may become more difficult, and erections themselves may become painful.

This can be countered by regularly inducing erections, but that may become more and more difficult as time goes on.

##### 清澈的精液

The majority of the liquid that makes up ejaculate originates in the prostate. It is a completely clear fluid, with a slimy texture. The white color and stickiness that is usually attributed to male ejaculate is caused by semen and seminal fluid from the testicles. The production of both semen and seminal fluid is a product of testicle function, so as the testicles shutdown (either because of anti-androgens or from estrogen dominance), these fluids halt, leaving only the prostate fluid.

Some people lose even that, and stop having any emissions at all during orgasm.

Needless to say, this comes with sterility. Contrary to what some sources report, this is NOT permanent, and many people have been able to restore testicle functionality by halting hormone therapy, either for detransition or for reproductive purposes.

##### 睾丸缩小

Once the testes have stopped functioning, the cells start to atrophy, shrinking over time. This atrophy may be accompanied with pain, sometimes in the form of a soreness or a dull throbbing sensation, or sometimes as registering as little sparks of pain that travel along the perineal nerve from the testicles down to the rectum.

### 性欲改变

Initial start of HRT may result in a total loss of sex drive as testosterone levels plummet. This can last 3-12 months, and in some cases doesn't return at all. Starting progesterone often serves as catalyst for its return. If/when sex drive comes back, the new libido [may be a completely different experience](https://curvyandtrans.com/p/5BF1EA/libatious-libidos) that one may not recognize at first.

##### 性感带更加敏感

The entire body becomes more responsive to touch, and with that unlocks stronger erogenous zones. Breasts, abdomen, inner thighs and neck, in particular, become more arousal inducing.

##### 高潮

Orgasm changes significantly, both in the way it builds and how it is experienced (see link above), but additionally, if one is lucky, they will gain the ability to become multi-orgasmic with no refractory period. The cost of this is that orgasm may become harder to achieve, and one has to re-learn how to reach it. It also becomes easier to reach with a partner, which may have been the opposite before.

##### 吸引力

It is [not at all unheard of](https://www.them.us/story/sexual-attraction-after-transition) for a transgender person to experience a change in their sexual orientation with transition. This is almost always the result of the removal of self-imposed mental barriers, but hormone therapy often plays a role *in* that removal. In most cases this simply involves an expansion of ones attraction, from monosexual to bi/pansexual, but some people also discover that their attraction was largely rooted in self-interest and that their true attraction is reversed.

### 周期性现象

Obviously, we do not mean blood flow, that would be ludicrous. Symptoms vary greatly (just as they do in cisgender women) and typically last for 2-4 days, repeating every 26-32 days (though some report experiencing it bi-weekly). This happens independent of medication dosing schedules. The use of a period tracker app like Clue can reveal the pattern.

- Cramping in the intestine and abdominal muscles, ranging from a slight flutter in the gut to strong painful spasms.
- Bloating and water retention
- Gas, diarrhea and other intestinal issues.
- Emotional instability, mood swings and irrational thoughts
  - Heightened depression and dysmorphia
  - Depersonalization or dissociation.
  - Increased dysphoria
  - Irritability (PMS)
- Muscle and joint aches and pains
- Breast engorgement and nipple tenderness
- Acne
- Fatigue
- Appetite changes, spontaneous cravings (see: chocolate cravings)
- Spontaneous shifts in libido
- Changes in genital odor

No, there have not yet been studies on this yet, but it is reported by far, **far** too many individuals to be an anomaly (including by yours truly), and has been confirmed by multiple people's own doctors. There is also precedent of this happening with cisgender women who have had hysterectomies (I personally know two cisgender women who have cycles but do not menstruate, without any medical intervention).

Running on estrogen and progesterone activates a gene sequence which instructs the hypothalamus to attempt to cycle ovary and uterine behavior just as it does in female assigned individuals, regardless of the absence of ovaries or a uterus. This cycle affects numerous organs and subsystems in the body, causing the release of a variety of different hormones and enzymes that can affect function and even behavior.

A more thorough explanation of this will be coming in a later update to the site.
