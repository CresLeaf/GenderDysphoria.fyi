# 社会性烦躁

尽管我们试图尽量抵制并指出存在的性别歧视，它们仍然存在，而人们总是会被因为自身的性别而被强加期望。这当中最强烈的是婚姻与父母角色；“丈夫”、“妻子”、“母亲”、“父亲”，这些术语都带着大量的包袱。错误的角色——甚至是任何角色——都会像铅球一般沉重。你被给予了一整本充满着行为与喜好的书，而你被期望履行书中的要求。如果你不能满足这些要求，那你就会被视为一个坏配偶或坏父母。

一位生理性别为女性的父母可能会因为被贴上母亲的标签而经历严重的心理障碍。绝大多数的生育资源都*非常*被套上了女性的模子，所以哪怕是怀孕和分娩的过程都充满了性别期望。如果你怀孕了，那么你就被贴上了母亲的标签，不管你对自己的角色的实际感受如何，而随之而来的是一大堆关于护理、母乳喂养和抚养孩子的假设。

尝试 [准行化 (Passing, 即试图被社会默认为自己希望成为的性别的过程)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(gender)) 过程的跨性别者也会遇到这种情况。如果你抱着一个婴儿或照顾一个孩子，那你就被贴上了妈妈的标签（除非孩子是混血儿，那你会被降级为保姆，不过说远了）。这可以被看作是有效的 (valid)，因为这是表明你已经被看作是一个女人的迹象，但是当顺性别女性开始谈论她们生育过程的经验时这会非常*无效* (invalid)。

当你需要符合你认同性别的社会标准时，社会性烦躁可能以一些意想不到的方式出现。例如，许多跨性别女性有这样的故事：出于内心中的羞涩感，她们在开始转换前感到需要遮盖自己的胸部。对赤裸上身有用的不适是一个共同的特征，甚至在她们对真实自我没有了解的时候就已经浮现了。

### 羞耻感

不能达到这些角色的要求会被体现为*强烈的*羞愧和耻辱。在成长过程中保持非出柜状态并努力适应常见的社会性别模式往往会导致父母和同龄人的失望，因为他们的期望是不同的。父亲可能对他们的生理男性孩子不愿意参加体育或其他男性活动而感到失望。女性同龄人可能会对一个选择与男性社交圈混在一起的生理女性青少年表示不赞同。十几岁的男孩可能会排斥一个不加入他们的“幽默”的生理男性跨性别者。

这类情况可能会导致欺凌与虐待，使跨性别者感到孤立、孤独和不合群。这种分裂感随后产生了羞耻感，因为他们没能成为大家期望中的哪个人。然后，这表现为在其他心理烦躁之上的抑郁症，加剧了他们的痛苦。

这种羞耻感在暴露自己是跨性别的那一刻变的尤为强烈。仇视跨性别群体的朋友和家人对跨性别出柜后的消极反应，有时甚至是暴力反应，将这种羞耻感转化为极端的内疚和羞辱。婚姻中的成年跨性别者可能会对自己出柜而破坏配偶的生活而感到十分自责。他们可能会收到邻居与同龄人的指责，并担心这会影响到他们的配偶和/或孩子。

这也是性别烦躁的一种形式，因为如果这个人是顺性别者，就不会感受到这些影响。

羞耻感发挥作用的另一种方式是我们社会中存在的系统性跨性别恐惧。今天的跨性别成年人在他们的童年时期是看着恐跨的媒体长大的。美国社会中80年代末和90年代初对跨性别的“迷恋”对当时的跨性别孩子们是一种可怕的创伤：他们看着周围所有的成年人和同龄人嘲笑、讥讽和厌恶那些他们不仅认同，并且强烈同情和仰望的人。这种羞耻感伴随着我们的一生；这是许多跨性别者直到30多岁或更晚才出柜的根本原因，因为只有到了中年，他们才能克服这种羞耻感。

羞耻感也倾向于积累，直至它沸腾为激进的行动。在跨性别的历史中，一个很常见的方面就是他们会不断增加自己的表现、不断减少与自己的感觉相斗争，直到他们突然被羞耻感所征服，清除一切并发誓不再追求这些感觉。这种模式一遍又一遍地重复。

Societal Dysphoria *strongly* comes into play with courtship rituals. Being forced into being the boyfriend or girlfriend when you are not a boy or a girl is extremely disorienting and often feels very unfair. AMABs may find themselves wishing *they* were the one being pampered, and AFABs may become uncomfortable with the amount of attention they receive from their prospective partners (beyond the discomfort that women experience, as this includes genuine attention, not just unwanted attention). The expectations placed on them by their partners to fill these courtship roles may feel like a heavy burden to bear. By contrast, dating as your true gender becomes euphoric. Buy a trans girl flowers and see how much she swoons.

A closeted trans person may feel so much pressure to conform to heterosexuality that they suppress their own instincts with regards to relationships and take on a performative role. Many a trans woman has attempted to play the role of a heterosexual husband to a wife, only to realize with transition that they would much prefer the role of the wife. They may not even be attracted to women.

Beyond discomfort, many trans people realize that the dynamics of relationships that they have experienced simply did not fit the shape of how they appeared. Many trans people come to realize after transition that they had never actually dated like a cis person of their assigned gender, instead always having romantic relationships that fit their true orientation. Male to male and female to female relationships have completely different patterns from heterosexual relationships; different courtship rituals, different perceptions, different communication styles. Men relate differently to men than they do to women, and women to women differently than they do to men, even when they don't know they are men or women.

For example, I myself realized after coming out to my wife that all of my previous dating attempts had absolutely been sapphic in nature. My first order had always been to become good friends with them. Dates would never be labeled as dates because we would just sit and talk somewhere, hanging out together. Consequently, several of my relationships ended simply because I was too scared to make the first move out of destroying the friendship. I would spend half my waking day thinking about them and wanting to be around them, not out of sexual lust, but out of personal infatuation. My first girlfriend straight up told me on our first date that I was unlike any man she'd ever dated because I enjoyed talking instead of just trying to get physical. She broke up with me two months later because I wasn't as assertive as she wanted from a partner.

These dynamics get even more complex for non-binary people, some of whom can at best describe their dating style as Queer. Some struggle to identify what role they play in a relationship. Others take a specific role that is typically seen as a binary gendered role. Some non-binary people wish to be seen as a boyfriend/girlfriend, even if they are not a boy/girl. Some want to play a role seen by society as neutral or consisting of aspects from both binary roles.
