# 激素如何工作

正如我们在 [性别焦虑的原因](/gdb/causes) 一节中所描述的，每个人的DNA均包含男性与女性身体的遗传指令，而哪一条指令被使用则由你的性腺产生的激素控制。这种分化完全基于你是否拥有一个SRY基因，即在妊娠的第6-8周产生睾丸而不是卵巢的连锁反应。从那时起，人体的每一个性属性（第一性征或第二性征）都是这些性腺产生的激素的结果。

如果它们产生雌激素（主要是雌二醇），那么生殖器会形成外阴、阴道和子宫。如果它们产生雄性激素（主要是睾酮），那么生殖器就会形成阴茎和阴囊，将 [斯基恩氏腺](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%AF%E5%9F%BA%E6%81%A9%E6%B0%8F%E8%85%BA) 下移并扩大成前列腺。分化在此结束，直到9-10年后的青春期，而我们都知道青春期的作用。

所以这是怎么做到的呢？为什么细胞会这么分化？嗯，在我们解释这个问题之前，先来说明一下 **受体** 的概念。


## 激素受体

简单来说，受体就像汽车上的钥匙锁点火装置（等下，新车还有这东西嘛？）。身体里的每个细胞都有一套锁，用于激活该细胞内的不同功能。它们就像开关，向细胞发出信号，告诉它应该激活其基因序列的不同步分。每个受体只能接受某些化合物，就像锁只能接受某些钥匙一样，而不同的化学物质在转动钥匙时有不同的能力。有的可以完全启动汽车，而有的只能把它的车载音响打开。

化学物质适应受体的能力被称为 **关系结合亲和力**，它以一种化学物质和另一种化学物质相比与受体结合的可能性百分比来衡量。因此，例如如果激素B与激素A相比只有10%的时间结合，那么就说它有10%的结合亲和力。同样地，一种化学品转动钥匙的能力被称为 *跨活性能力*。适合受体但不做任何事情的化合物被称为 *拮抗剂*，能够转动钥匙的化合物被称为 **激动剂**。如果它只能转动一点点钥匙，它则被称为 **部分激动剂**。

你可以把拮抗剂想象成俱乐部的报表。他们站在门口，阻止其他东西通过，但自己不进入俱乐部。大多数拮抗剂被称为 **阻断剂**。这与 **抑制剂** 不同，后者是一种减缓化学反应的化合物，而 *激活剂* 则加速反应。在受体中，抑制剂降低了受体的能力，从而使其对与受体结合的事物的反应不那么有效，而激活剂则提高了受体的能力，使其反应更强，就像一个助推器。

在某些情况下，一种激素可以通过减缓或增加细胞中的行为，作为一种不同激素的抑制剂或激活剂。例如，孕酮增加细胞的活性，使细胞对雌激素和雄激素的反应更有效，而睾酮增加多巴胺受体的处理能力，因此在大脑中需要更少的多巴胺来达到同样的效果。

## Whats in a Hormone

There are four main kinds of hormones:

- [Amino Acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) such as Melatonin which controls sleep, or Thyroxine which regulates the metabolism.
- [Peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_hormone), like Oxytocin and Insulin, which are collections of Amino Acids.
- [Eicosanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid) that are formed from lipids and fatty acids and predominantly affect the immune system
- [Steroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid) are signaling molecules produced by various internal organs in order to pass messages to other organs within the body.

}}</div> }!}

For the purposes of transition, this last category is what we care about the most, as all of the sex hormones are steroids. They fall into seven main categories:

- [Androgens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen)
- [Estrogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen)
- [Progestagins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestogen)
- [Glucocorticoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid)
- [Mineralcorticoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralocorticoid)
- [Neurosteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid)
- [Aminosteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminosteroid)

The first three of these are what we care about most when it comes to Hormone Therapy. Note: All human beings, regardless of phenotype, have some of every one of these hormones in their bodies. The ratios are what affect body shape.


### Androgens

There are nearly a dozen different androgens, but the ones we care about the most are [Testosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone) and [Dihydrotestosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone).

Testosterone is the primary masculinizing hormone for the human body and is produced in the adrenal glands, the testes, and in the ovaries (where it is immediately converted into estrone and estradiol). It tells both muscle and bone cells to grow and in higher concentrations encourages larger muscle mass and thicker skeletal structure. This also means that Testosterone is critical for bone health, as it affects calcium distribution within the skeletal structure. Thus, severe depletion of testosterone can result in osteoperosis and fragile bones. Testosterone also plays a major role in sex drive and libido, encouraging mating behavior within the cerebral cortex.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is converted from Testosterone in the prostate, skin and liver, plays a major role in the development of the male genitalia during puberty by inducing random erections, and the growth of facial and body hair. Paradoxically, DHT is also what causes male pattern baldness, as it chokes off blood circulation to the follicles on the top of the scalp (sorry, trans guys, it's a double edged sword). DHT binds to androgen receptors ten times more strongly than testosterone, which is why it is critical to eliminate it for feminizing transition.


### Estrogens

There are four estrogens: [Estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol), [Estrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone), Estriol and Estetrol. The latter two are only produced during pregnancy and are important for fetal health, but have no bearing on transition.

Estradiol is the Feminizing hormone, as it is the primary signaling hormone for growth in the mammary glands (breast tissue), and because it encourages fat deposits in the thighs, hips, butt, chest and arms, while discouraging fat deposits in the abdomen, thus producing a curvier figure. Estradiol also promote increased collagen production, resulting in softer skin and more flexible tendons & ligaments.

Estrone's role in the body has been something of a puzzle in medical research, as it has significantly lower binding affinity compared to estradiol (0.6%) and very low transactivational ability (4%). The hormone doesn't appear to *do* anything, it just sits in the blood stream. However it has a unique ability to convert to and from Estradiol via an enzyme group called [17β-HSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B2-Hydroxysteroid_dehydrogenase), making it ideally suited to function like an estrogen battery within the body.

New research is starting to suggest that the body may regulate total estradiol levels by releasing HSD17B1 to turn estradiol into estrone, and releasing HSD17B2 to convert it back, however this is very early study. Both enzymes are produced in breast tissue, and may play a role in the presence of cyclical period-like symptoms in estrogenic individuals who do not have ovaries, such as trans women.

{!{ <div class="gutter"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title">For Your Information</h4> }!}

**Why aren't AFAB trans people prescribed estrogen blockers alongside testosterone?**

There are two separate sources for estrogens within the female reproductive system. Ovaries contains thousands of follicles, cell structures which produce eggs. The pituitary gland produces luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which encourages the follicles to grow into luteal cells. Theca cells within the follicle produce testosterone, and granulosa cells produce the enzyme [aromatase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase), which converts that testosterone into estradiol. This is the first source of estrogen, but it is not the largest source.

Note: This is why PCOS causes ovaries to produce testosterone; the ovarian cysts disrupt the aromatase production, so the testosterone does not get converted.

Two weeks into the period cycle the hypothalamus tells the pituitary gland to produce an LH and FSH spike three to four times stronger than earlier in the cycle. That surge causes the follicles to swell until one pops, releasing an egg, at which point the remains of the follicle become a structure known as the corpus luteum. That corpus luteum then begins to produce progesterone and significantly more estrogens in order to prepare the womb for a fertilized egg. This is the second source.

Taking testosterone causes the hypothalamus to deactivate the genes that initiate this LH and FSH spike, so the follicles never reach maturity, ovulation never occurs, and the corpus luteum is never formed, removing a significant source of estrogen within the ovaries.

*So no, Reddit, it isn't just "because testosterone is stronger", it's because ovaries are a hell of a lot more complex than testes and are easier to disrupt. Please stop spreading this falsehood.*

### Progestagins

The primary progestogin is [progesterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone), which plays numerous roles in the body and has been found to be [an important component for feminizing hormone therapy](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/4/1181/5270376).

One of the largest roles that the progestogin receptor plays is in the regulation of gonadal function (ovaries and testies). The hypothalamus is positively *littered* with progestogin receptors and responds strongly to their activation, downregulating the production of [GnRH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone), which then reduces the production of [luteinizing hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone) by the pituitary gland.

LH is what tells the ovaries and testes to produce estrogen and androgens. LH and its sibling hormone [FSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone) both play central roles in ovulation, which is another large source of estrogen in ovary-havers. Thus, synthetic progestins, chemicals that fit into progestogin receptors, are often included in birth control in order to prevent ovulation. In AMABs, progestogins are a useful tool for blocking testosterone production.

Another type of cell that is full of progestogin receptors is mammary tissue. Progesterone plays a major role in the growth and maturation of milk ducts within breast tissue. While little formal research has been conducted into progesterone's effect on breast development, anecdotally it has been seen widely across the transfem community to provide significant improvements in breast fullness. Progesterone has also been demonstrated to increase blood flow to breast tissue, and encourages fat deposits in the breasts, both of which increase breast size.

Additionally, progesterone promotes better sleep, improves cardiovascular health, increases ketogenesis (reducing triglycerides), increases metabolic function, and has been found to reduce breast cancer risk.

### Mineralcorticoids

Mineralcorticoids play no role in transition, but they are worth mentioning because of one major hormone: [Aldosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone).

Aldosterone is what instructs the kidneys to *stop* extracting water from the blood stream. It is produced by the adrenal glands in order to regulate body hydration. Why is this significant?

Because one drug that is very commonly used in trans hormone therapy is an extremely powerful aldosterone antagonist... Spironolactone. Spiro binds to mineralcorticoid receptors more strongly than aldosterone does, but does not activate the receptor. It just clogs it, preventing the kidneys from receiving the signal to stop extracting water.

This is why spiro makes people pee so much.
